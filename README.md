# Resource Inventory

Welcome to my resource inventory. This is a kit with all my bookmarked resources that I use as a developer. This information contained is constantly changing as I grow in my development skills, getting more exposure and learning new things.

## Motivation

This idea was born when I was learning about Time Management. An author on Pluralsight coined this term. 

## What you will find

In this kit, you will find defferent sections, some covering:

- learning platforms
- books
- download sites
- favourite mentors
